      <h3>I started a reading habit when covid hit and this was one of the first books I kicked it all off with. Inspiring, positive read. This book is centered around maximizing team potential through positive culture. I am going to highlight the top idea right here. To feel like you are fulfiling your potential, you have to meet three psychological needs:
      <br>
      <br>
      1) Competence. Start with simple tasks on this one and build it up.
      <br>
      <br>
      2) Relate and connect with others. I think better yet, show care for others.
      <br>
      <br>
      3) Autonomy and freedom of choice
      </h3>
      <hr class="w3-opacity">
      <br>
      <br>
      Key Ideas:
      <br>
      <br>
      Positive culture triumphs bonus schemes. I cannot agree more on this point. Of course, this really is about alignment and this can be achieved more than just by financial upside (else we would not have unhappy bankers!)
      <br>
      <br>
      Radical transparency allows for shared responsibility and participation by everyone. This gives each team member the ability to feel like they can effect a change, and avoids learned helplessness. This is something echoed by Ray Dalio and the way things are done at Bridgewater.
      <br>
      <br>
      Flat hierarchy achieves the same. Everyone is able to challenge, participate and grow. Small autonomous teams are also more nimble and able to innovate.
      <br>
      <br>
      Empower the people. I always think the best footballers do not become the best team managers. Empower people and give them ownership. They will blow you away. My ex-boss (the legendary Michael Richter) was such a leader. He always told me his job was to remove any barriers in the way of me doing my job.
      <br>
      <br>Believing in something bigger than yourself. When a team has a shared identity and purporse, for love and not for money, they create an amazing community that contributes for the common goal. I have witnessed this with projects that have no clear financial upside, yet participants are willing and able. Echoes "Start with Why" by Mr Simon Sinek.
      <br>
      <br>
      Perfection is the enemy of good. I've started to do this myself. 80% is good enough is the mantra I am going with. Saves me time and decision paralysis. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Curiosity. The average CEO reads, on average, 60 books a year. Knowledge is power. Reading is the means. Foster a curious culture and employees will learn to ask better questions over time. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The three most powerful words a leader can say: ‘I don’t know.’ What this is really saying is honesty and humility. Ask for help, you get to share the burden and at the same time empower someone else. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Finally, for all of the above to happen, they cannot exist in a culture of fear 
      <br>
      <br>
      PS: Work for Patagonia if you can. They give you time to go surfing.
