      <h1>I used to think computers could do everything investing related. Then, I stumbled into a job with one of the best value investors and started to fall in love with it. This book takes the principles and characteristics of the best value investors in the world and shows that it can be applied by everyone to all facets of life. Thanks to my friend Mr Matt Szeto who recommended it to me.</h1>

      Key Ideas:
      <br>
      <br>
      It is important to keep an inner scorecard and not be influenced by an external scorecard. Simply put, the need for public recognition and approval by others can easily lead us in the wrong direction. The more you do this, the stronger you will develop your own compass in life.
      <br>
      <br>
      Moments of extreme clarity that come are to be cherished, as they are rare. I seem to believe that if you develop a strong inner scorecard, clarity will come knocking on your door more often. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Analysis paralysis is a think. I happen to think this, alongside the paradox of choice, is where most of us get stuck. My new rule in life, if it's 80% good enough, then just do it. 
      <br>
      <br>
      It is important to be kind and helpful to others, especially those early in their careers. This is just being human, and I think we can do more of that in this world.
      <br>
      <br>
      Alignment of interests. Especially in fund management, when the interests of the fund manager is not aligned, or simply put lacks skin in the game, then it is a clear sign that something is wrong. There are plenty in this industry who are plain greedy, and do not have the skills nor acumen for managing money. If they are not willing to invest their family's money alongside yours, then forget about them.
      <br>
      <br>
      It is easy to get sucked into the environment around you. Be around a materialistic environment, and you will pursue material wealth. Our environment is stronger than our intellect. This applies to both the physical environment around you, as well as your friendship groups. Also, beware of FOMO. Echoes having a strong inner scorecard --> more clarity.
      <br>
      <br>
      Envy is only one of the seven deadly sins that is no fun. It is destructive and simply not cool. Learn to get over it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Great financial advice beware of debt and being over-leveraged. What is over-leveraged? Err on the side of caution, and give plenty of breathing room. Be prudent in living and that will reduce chances of making bad decisions from desperation.
